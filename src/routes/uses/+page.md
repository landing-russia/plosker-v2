# Uses

**Here's some stuff I use**

Each default color theme includes a hand-designed dark mode version that you can trigger by adding the prose-invert class.

```js
// JavaScript goes here,
// And will be syntax-highlighted!
import { sineIn } from "svelte/easing"
  let hidden1 = true
  let transitionParams = {
    x: -320,
    duration: 200,
    easing: sineIn,
  }
```
